# Task2---WebEngage---UI
This mini project is been created for the task submission of WebEngage
The task specifications are mentioned below:
1. Create a HTML Page as per the screenshot attached. This should be Mobile Responsive.

2. In the same page above, if the browser is chrome, create a function which checks the Query parameter named "ayush" in the URL of the page (which can have any value between 0 to 10), and based on the value auto-select the same radio button.

For example when the page has a query parameter ?ayush=9 then the 9th Radio Button should be selected in the page.

4. Now the 9th would be selected by the function, if I manually change it to any other button, it should not change and go back to 9th, based on the URL.

The entire UI is first designed as a prototype on Figma and further executed using HTML and CSS, the button selection is performed by javascript.
